Given an input layer, return an output *.lyr layer file containing a random selection of features.

To use, copy the *.tbx and *.py files to the same directory, then add the toolbox to ArcMap or ArcCatalog. 
Double-click to open the Random Selection tool and choose an input featureclass in the first dialog box, specify a new output layer file (*.lyr) in the second box, and the percentage of features to return in the 3rd box.

The new output *.lyr file can then be added to ArcMap using the Add Data button.
