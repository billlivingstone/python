MakeXYEventLayer_management(table, in_x_field, in_y_field, out_layer, {spatial_reference}, {in_z_field})
 Creates a new point feature layer based on X and Y coordinates defined in a
source table. If the source table contains Z coordinates (e.g., elevation values), that field can also be specified in the creation of the event layer. The layer created by this tool is temporary.

     INPUTS:
      table (Table View):
  The table containing the X and Y coordinates that define the locations of the point features in the output event layer.
      in_x_field (Field):
  The field in the input table that contains the X coordinates.
      in_y_field (Field):
  The field in the input table that contains the Y coordinates.
      spatial_reference {Spatial Reference}:
  The spatial reference of the coordinates in the X and Y Fields defined above. This will be the output event layer's spatial reference.
      in_z_field {Field}:
  The field in the input table that contains the Z coordinates.

     OUTPUTS:
      out_layer (Feature Layer):
  The name of the output point event layer.
